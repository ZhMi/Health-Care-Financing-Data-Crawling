For the portion of the year that he/she was not resident in Finland, he/she would be taxable only on any Finnish-source income.
Income tax is calculated by applying a progressive state tax rate schedule (maximum 31.75 percent in 2015) and a flat municipal tax rate (varies from municipality to municipality, e.g. in Helsinki 18.5 percent in 2015) to taxable income. Investment income up to EUR340,000 is taxed at 30 percent and investment income exceeding EUR340,000 is taxed at 33 percent in 2015, church tax and employee’s sickness insurance contribution may be levied in connection with income taxation.

is present in Afghanistan in that tax year for a period or periods aggregating to 183 days or more or
is an employee or official of the Government of Afghanistan irrespective of where he/she is performing his duties of employment 

Salary for services performed within Afghansitan is considered Afghan-sourced and is taxable in Afghanistan except where a bilateral or multilateral agreement between the government of Afghanisan and another country provides otherwise.
Salaried individuals are taxed at progressive rates ranging from 2% to 20%. Basic exemption is allowed at AFN 5,000 per month (AFN 60,000 per annum). Employees having their only source of income as salary where tax has been withheld and deposited by the empoyer in accordance with the prescribed rates given in the law are not required to file annual income tax return. However, they are required to file annual statement of salary and tax deduction after end of the tax year.
Taxes are charged in local currency that is Afghanis (AFN). If the income is received in any foreign currency, it is converted on average of free rates used by the Central Bank to purchase such foreign currency at the end of each month."

Non-Greek residents are taxed only on Greek-source income.
The legal provisions designed to prevent tax evasion specify that individuals filing a tax return in Greece are taxed on the higher of their declared income or imputed income. Income is imputed on the basis of living expenditure or acquisition of certain assets. The main factors considered in imputing income from living expenses or acquisitions are:

The engine size of owned motor vehicles
The repayment of loans
The purchase of real estate
The construction, acquisition, or leasing of buildings,
Acquisition or leasing of other assets, such as motor cars or pleasure boats
The deemed rental payments for a secondary residence or more than one secondary residencies, as well as primary residence (by reference to the residence’s surface)
The construction, maintenance, and use of a swimming pool (outdoor/indoor by reference to the pool’s surface)
Amounts donated to individuals including monetary parental donations
Other factors, such as the annual expense of the tuition fees or housekeeping staff.
Purchase of market shares and other tiles, contributions made for the purchase of business or contributions for capital increase etc.

Under certain circumstances, taxpayers have the right to contest imputed income assessed on the basis of their lifestyle by providing evidence that the difference between the imputed income and the declared income is covered b borrowing or savings that have been taxed or exempted from tax in the past from gifts, which have been subject to or exempt from gift tax, income taxed abroad (or exempted), and imported to Greece etc.

",Sat Aug 01 04:00:00 UTC 2015,"This document sets out the general tax regime in relation to international executives in Ghana.  It therefore gives an insight into the Ghana Tax Law requirements in relation to employment and other related taxes. 
Under the Ghana Income Tax Law (Act 592), a person is taxed on incomes derived from or accruing in Ghana.  In relation to employment, a person is taxed on all gains or profits from that employment, unless the gain or profit is specifically exempt.  The gains or profits from any employment of a person is treated as accruing in or derived from Ghana to the extent to which the employment is exercised in Ghana, regardless of the place of payment.  Any amount, benefit or allowance is a gain or profit from the employment if it is provided:

By the employer, a third party under an arrangement with the employer or an associate of the employer;
To an employee or an associate of an employee; and
In respect of past, present or prospective employment.

International Executives who exercise employment in Ghana will be subject to tax on all benefits that shall be attributable to them as a result of the exercise of the employment irrespective of who pays them or where they are paid from. 
Taxes on employment income are administered through the Pay-As-You-Earn system.  By this, the employer is required to withhold tax on the gains or profits attributable to the employee and pay same to the Ghana Revenue Authority on monthly basis. 
There is also a requirement for making social security contributions.  However, the implementation regarding expatriates is still under discussions between the National Pensions Regulatory Authority (NPRA) and the Ghana Employers’ Association.  In the meantime, the NPRA has directed that the total expatriate social security contributions should be paid to privately managed mandatory pension fund.  
Contrary to the NPRA’s position, there has been a recent gazette of the National Pensions (Amendment) Act 2014 (Act 883) which directs expatriates to make their contributions to the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (Tier 1 Scheme). "

Contrary to the NPRA’s position, there has been a recent gazette of the National Pensions (Amendment) Act 2014 (Act 883) which directs expatriates to make their contributions to the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (Tier 1 Scheme). "

Income tax is imposed on a territorial basis. Individuals, whether resident or non-resident in Malaysia, are taxed on income accruing in or derived from Malaysia. Foreign income remitted into Malaysia is exempted from tax.1
The income of a resident individual is subject to income tax at progressive rates after personal relief while the income of a non-resident individual is subject to income tax at the top marginal rate without personal relief.2
Non-resident individuals may claim tax exemption on their Malaysian employment income if they exercise employment in Malaysia for a period or periods of 60 days or less in a calendar year or for a period of not more than 60 days if such period overlaps two calendar years.3 However, if the individuals who are exercising employment in Malaysia for more than 60 days but less than 183 days, and are tax residents of a country in which Malaysia has a double taxation treaty, exemption may be available provided other conditions as stipulated in the double taxation treaty are met.

",Fri Jan 02 00:00:00 UTC 2015,"In the United States, residents are generally taxed on their worldwide compensation regardless of where or for whom the services are performed. Compensation includes cash remuneration and the fair market value of property or services received. Special exclusions may apply to the foreign earned income of a citizen or resident for services performed in a country other than the United States.
Non-residents1 are subject to U.S. tax on income from U.S. sources. U.S . source income that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (generally investment income) is taxed on a gross basis at a flat 30 percent rate, unless a treaty provides for a lower rate. A non-resident engaged in a trade or business within the United States during the taxable year is taxed on the income effectively connected with the U.S. trade or business, less allowable deductions, at the same graduated rates that apply to the income of citizens and residents. Generally, income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business includes compensation for personal services performed in the United States.
A foreign national who changes from U.S. resident status to non-resident status or vice versa during a year (a dual-status taxpayer) is subject to U.S. tax as if the year were divided into two separate periods, one of residence and one of non-residence. The dual-status foreign national is generally subject to tax on worldwide income for the period of residence, and only on U.S . source income for the period of non-residence.
Under domestic law, if a non-resident is in the United States for 90 days or less during a calendar year, performs services for a foreign employer that is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, and earns USD3,000 or less for such U.S. services, the compensation is treated as foreign source and is not subject to U.S. tax. Most treaties provide broader exemptions from U.S. tax for earned income, allowing a higher, or no, limit if the nonresident is present in the United States for no more than 183 days during a 12-month period, provided certain requirements are met.
The federal income tax rates range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent.
The official United States currency is the United States Dollar (USD).

However, if a double tax treaty or Swiss internal law provides specifically for taxation by the country of source (such as on income from real estate situated abroad, income from a permanent establishment situated abroad), the exempt income is only taken into consideration for the purposes of determining the applicable tax rate (exemption with progression).
Non-residents are subject to taxation on certain categories of income from Swiss sources.
The multi-layered tax system means that there are no average tax rates. Taxes can only be calculated based on the specific circumstances of an individual based on the applicable cantonal and communal tax laws.
The maximum effective federal income tax rates rise to is 11.5 percent of taxable income. The various cantonal and municipal rates are also levied on a progressive scale, with a maximum combined rate (the highest of which is approximately 44 percent). In addition, social security taxes may be payable.

A series of articles written by KPMG Global Indirect Tax Services professionals to help you better understand and prepare to deal with the Big Data revolution in the context of indirect taxes.
",Fri Oct 23 16:32:00 UTC 2015,"Businesses today are beginning to adapt to a world increasingly driven by data and analytics (D&A). Findings of a recent KPMG International survey indicate that all but 1 percent of organizations surveyed regard D&A as at least somewhat important to their business strategy and 56 percent said they changed their business strategy to meet the challenges of D&A, most often to increase their capacity to analyze big data. 
Are we in the midst of a Big Data revolution? Analysts believe that the quantity of data available to businesses will increase by 40 percent every year for the foreseeable future. Endeavoring to collect all this data is one thing, but businesses increasingly need to correlate it, analyze it and extract actionable value.
And what about the tax implications? Relatively little has been written about the specific application of Big Data to the world of tax, and more specifically to the area of indirect tax. By their very nature, indirect taxes contain transaction level data which, when mined and analyzed appropriately, may be transformed into knowledge and real actionable value for businesses.
Welcome to “Going beyond the data – Indirect Tax”, a series of technical articles written by KPMG Global Indirect Tax Services professionals to help you better understand and prepare to deal with the Big Data revolution in the context of indirect taxes. The article series will appear in Bloomberg BNA’s International Tax Planning: Indirect Tax publication over the coming months and added to this page.
“Going beyond the data – Indirect Tax” will explore tax policy and administration in the age of Big Data; transformation of the compliance function into competitive advantage; the use of technology tools essential for the tax function in a Big Data world; and the anticipated evolution of indirect taxation over the next decade on account of the Big Data revolution."

The view from the top: CEOs see a powerful future for the CFO
","
CEOs are looking to their CFOs to expand their focus beyond governance and regulatory requirements, to harness technology and to enhance their role by contributing as a strategic growth partner in the C-suite. Many CEOs are not sure if their CFO is the right person to handle talent management and contribute to big-picture thinking.
",Tue Dec 09 05:00:00 UTC 2014,"The View from the Top is a new KPMG survey, conducted in collaboration with Forbes Insights, which explores the attributes of a high-performing CFO and the expectations that CEOs, business owners, chairmen of large companies, and thought leaders have of their finance function.
It reveals that there is a clear disconnect between the actual performance of the CFOs and the expectations of their bosses. For filling this gap, CFOs need to focus more on understanding their stakeholders and not remain within their finance bubble. They need to be more of a business leader and less of a finance executive.
Another important issue highlighted in the survey is that CEOs place huge value on people skills and don’t believe their CFOs are managing their finance teams well enough. Wider business partnering and leadership skills are now seen as core competencies on top of finance skills, and as a result, CFOs need to ensure they, and their teams up-skill sufficiently to meet those expectations.
The CFO must assess the ever-expanding amount of data (including non-financial information) for relevance to create insights and foresights that facilitate better and faster business decisions. A third issue concerns the higher regulatory burden. The value of the CFO decreases when they are perceived to be bogged down in compliance and risk issues."

","
Taxation of international executives
",Sat Aug 01 16:00:00 UTC 2015,"In China, the scope of taxation for individuals is generally determined by two factors:

domicile status
length of residence in China.

An individual who is domiciled in China is liable to income tax on worldwide income. This means that regardless of where the income is sourced or received, this income is subject to tax in China.
A non-domicile of China is taxed in accordance with length of residence. A non-domicile who resides in China for no more than five years is taxed on income derived within China. A non-domicile who resides in China for more than five full consecutive years (long-term resident) may be taxed on worldwide income from the sixth year of residence onwards.
If a non-domicile is present in China for 90 days or less during a year, the compensation received for performance of services in China is not subject to tax if the economic employer of the individual is not a Chinese entity during his/her assignment in China and the costs of such employment are not borne by an entity within China. Where a tax treaty is applicable, a non-domicile may be exempt from tax in China for income earned during periods of up to 183 days in China during a taxable year, or a 12-month period, provided certain requirements are met.
The income tax rates on employment income range from 3 percent to 45 percent. Investment income and capital gains are generally taxed at a flat rate of 20 percent unless otherwise indicated.
The official currency of China is the China Yuan Renminbi (RMB).

Findings of a recent KPMG International survey indicate that all but 1 percent of organizations surveyed regard D&A as at least somewhat important to their business strategy and 56 percent said they changed their business strategy to meet the challenges of D&A, most often to increase their capacity to analyze big data. 
Are we in the midst of a Big Data revolution? Analysts believe that the quantity of data available to businesses will increase by 40 percent every year for the foreseeable future.

Ecuadorian-source income includes income received by Ecuadorians and foreign nationals in respect of work, professional, commercial, industrial, agricultural, mining services, and others of an economic nature carried out in Ecuadorian territory.
Income tax is calculated by applying a progressive tax rate schedule, from 5 percent to a maximum of 35 percent of taxable income.

Non-residents performing temporary services are taxed at a flat rate of 22 percent regardless of where paid. Non-residents performing permanent services are taxed at the progressive tax rates of a resident that is, taxed in the same way as services rendered by an individual residing in the country.
Beginning in 2008, the deduction of expenses over the taxable basis of the income tax is permitted for individuals; this deduction corresponds to a maximum of 1.3 over the base in effect or maximum 50 percent of taxable income, whichever is first.

",Mon Apr 15 18:27:00 UTC 2013,"For businesses investing in their long term prospects, the potential reward from better reporting is the basis for a more effective dialogue with investors. A dialogue based on a broader perspective on business value that could ultimately support a lower cost of capital for those able to make their case effectively.
For investors, the potential opportunity lies in aligning reporting more closely with shareholder perspectives on business value. Focusing on the key drivers of future performance alongside the picture of past performance provided by the financials."

Taxation of international executives
",Fri Jan 02 00:00:00 UTC 2015,"In the United States, residents are generally taxed on their worldwide compensation regardless of where or for whom the services are performed. Compensation includes cash remuneration and the fair market value of property or services received. Special exclusions may apply to the foreign earned income of a citizen or resident for services performed in a country other than the United States.
Non-residents1 are subject to U.S. tax on income from U.S. sources. U.S . source income that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (generally investment income) is taxed on a gross basis at a flat 30 percent rate, unless a treaty provides for a lower rate. A non-resident engaged in a trade or business within the United States during the taxable year is taxed on the income effectively connected with the U.S. trade or business, less allowable deductions, at the same graduated rates that apply to the income of citizens and residents. Generally, income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business includes compensation for personal services performed in the United States.
A foreign national who changes from U.S. resident status to non-resident status or vice versa during a year (a dual-status taxpayer) is subject to U.S. tax as if the year were divided into two separate periods, one of residence and one of non-residence. The dual-status foreign national is generally subject to tax on worldwide income for the period of residence, and only on U.S . source income for the period of non-residence.
Under domestic law, if a non-resident is in the United States for 90 days or less during a calendar year, performs services for a foreign employer that is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, and earns USD3,000 or less for such U.S. services, the compensation is treated as foreign source and is not subject to U.S. tax. Most treaties provide broader exemptions from U.S. tax for earned income, allowing a higher, or no, limit if the nonresident is present in the United States for no more than 183 days during a 12-month period, provided certain requirements are met.
The federal income tax rates range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent.
The official United States currency is the United States Dollar (USD).
Herein, the host country refers to the country to which the employee is assigned. The home country refers to the country where the assignee lives when he or she is not on assignment.

Today's unprecedented economic challenges are forcing companies to rethink the way they do business. For many, this includes taking a closer look at how they manage their compliance obligations on a world-wide basis. By outsourcing an organization can, at a minimum, capitalize on the economies of scale, specialized labor and the application of industry best practices (assuring processes are aligned with current regulatory demands) available through an external service provider.
",Thu May 09 04:00:00 UTC 2013,"Managing tax and statutory compliance in today’s highly complex economic and regulatory environment is no easy task. Rapid globalization, new developments in tax laws, changes in accounting standards and increased demands from revenue authorities for greater transparency and cooperation are all increasing the burden on tax and finance departments. At the same time, they are expected to provide more and better reporting and compliance in an ever shorter time frame. Complicating matters are a dearth of qualified, experienced compliance professionals and the challenge of obtaining timely and accurate data from accounting and ERP systems and shared service centers not often set up for in-country compliance.
Given these challenges, it’s not surprising that tax and finance departments often spend a disproportionate amount of time on compliance activities, rather than focusing on higher value activities such as strategic tax planning, risk management and closer integration with the rest of the business.
As a result, many companies are looking for more consistent, more efficient and more cost effective ways to meet their compliance obligations."

The Future of Corporate Reporting
","
As the global economy continues to reform its financial system, one crucial element of reconstruction is being ignored. The corporate reporting model in its current form does not meet the needs of investors – and it’s becoming increasingly difficult for the model to meet the requirements of preparers, auditors, regulators and standard-setters. Now is the time to begin a wide-ranging debate about what is wrong with the current model and how to change it.
",Thu Feb 07 05:00:00 UTC 2013,"We interviewed ten reporting leaders to test the premise that fundamental reform is needed.
In KPMG’s The future of corporate reporting: towards a common vision we tested the premise that fundamental reforms were needed by interviewing these ten international leaders in the field:

Neri Bukspan, Executive Managing Director at Standard & Poor's
Stephen Haddrill, CEO of the UK’s Financial Reporting Council
Hans Hoogervorst, Chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board
Julie Hudson, Head of Global Sustainability at UBS
Brian Hunt, CEO of the Canadian Public Accountability Board
Christoph Hütten, Senior Vice President, and Mark Deinert, Executive Vice President, at SAP
 Mervyn King, Chairman of the International Integrated Reporting Council
Sandra Peters, Head of Financial Reporting Policy at the CFA Institute
Russell Picot, Group Chief Accounting Officer at HSBC
Joachim Schindler, Former Global Head of Audit at KPMG International

All agreed on the need for change, but they did not concur on how far-reaching the reforms had to be or what should be altered.
Investors want forward-looking information from companies so they can assess the ability to create sustainable long-term value. Preparers need to connect the dots better in their public communications so that the balance of risk and opportunity is clearer. Regulators are demanding more accountability from corporate boards, and standard setters want to raise the bar for disclosure and analysis."

",Mon Jul 28 13:56:00 UTC 2014,"Now that the IASB has published a completed standard on financial instruments accounting – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014) – the real work for insurance companies is just beginning.
The new standard presents revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment, and supplements the new general hedge accounting requirements published in 2013.
Insurers can expect a sea-change in financial reporting over the next few years as they plan for adoption of new standards on both financial instruments and insurance contracts.
Before insurers reach any conclusions about how they apply IFRS 9, they will want to consider its interaction with the forthcoming insurance contracts standard."

Going beyond the data
","
A series of articles written by KPMG Global Indirect Tax Services professionals to help you better understand and prepare to deal with the Big Data revolution in the context of indirect taxes.
",Fri Oct 23 16:32:00 UTC 2015,"Businesses today are beginning to adapt to a world increasingly driven by data and analytics (D&A). Findings of a recent KPMG International survey indicate that all but 1 percent of organizations surveyed regard D&A as at least somewhat important to their business strategy and 56 percent said they changed their business strategy to meet the challenges of D&A, most often to increase their capacity to analyze big data. 
Are we in the midst of a Big Data revolution? Analysts believe that the quantity of data available to businesses will increase by 40 percent every year for the foreseeable future. Endeavoring to collect all this data is one thing, but businesses increasingly need to correlate it, analyze it and extract actionable value.
And what about the tax implications? Relatively little has been written about the specific application of Big Data to the world of tax, and more specifically to the area of indirect tax. By their very nature, indirect taxes contain transaction level data which, when mined and analyzed appropriately, may be transformed into knowledge and real actionable value for businesses.
Welcome to “Going beyond the data – Indirect Tax”, a series of technical articles written by KPMG Global Indirect Tax Services professionals to help you better understand and prepare to deal with the Big Data revolution in the context of indirect taxes. The article series will appear in Bloomberg BNA’s International Tax Planning: Indirect Tax publication over the coming months and added to this page.
“Going beyond the data – Indirect Tax” will explore tax policy and administration in the age of Big Data; transformation of the compliance function into competitive advantage; the use of technology tools essential for the tax function in a Big Data world; and the anticipated evolution of indirect taxation over the next decade on account of the Big Data revolution."

AML and the De-Risking Dilemma
","
In the global war to combat money laundering, the financial services industry appears to be nearing a dangerous tipping point. The unprecedented amount of attention being paid to AML activities in boardrooms around the globe these days is due, in large part, to the increasingly harsh penalties being doled out to institutions deemed to run afoul of AML regulations – punishments that can include billion-dollar fines, banks being stripped of their operating licenses and threats of criminal prosecution against financial institutions and the executives who are paid to lead them.
",Tue Sep 15 18:30:00 UTC 2015,"While the goal of preventing or, at the very least, minimizing money laundering and terrorist financing is critically important, regulators must be attuned to the possibility that this growing de-risking backlash could end up creating more risk within the financial system.

Uncharted waters: LNG demand in a transforming industry
","
A transforming LNG market is marked by globalization, changing pricing models, and major demand uncertainties. Prices have fallen sharply and the market appears likely to be over-supplied for some years.
",Mon Nov 16 12:11:00 UTC 2015,"Traditional Japan-South Korea-Taiwan LNG buyers appear mature, while European demand depends heavily on Russian strategies, as well as environmental policy. Chinese LNG requirements are key, but influenced strongly by pipeline gas competition, economic growth and coal use. Emerging LNG markets in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and in transport (shipping and road) present a major growth opportunity, but have to be developed actively.
Such an LNG market presents all participants with challenges. Uncertainty over demand from traditionally dominant buyers requires eyes for new markets from LNG producers and traders. They have to understand buyers' strategies and maintain optionality and competitiveness in their portfolio of supply – and be ready to launch new projects quickly -- when market conditions permit.
Buyers, conversely, should make the most of their current strong position, while deploying new strategies. They need to understand their bargaining position as well as that of sellers; engaging on regulation and government policy; and creating buyer alliances such as Japan's JERA.
The winners along the value chain will be those who can act counter cyclically, who can create and maximize markets, instead of reacting passively to them, who can identify the major long-term trends driving LNG demand, while also staying flexible to seize emerging opportunities."

Insurance – Implementing IFRS 9

The new financial instruments standard is part of a sea-change in reporting for insurers.
",Mon Jul 28 13:56:00 UTC 2014,"Now that the IASB has published a completed standard on financial instruments accounting – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014) – the real work for insurance companies is just beginning.
The new standard presents revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment, and supplements the new general hedge accounting requirements published in 2013.
Insurers can expect a sea-change in financial reporting over the next few years as they plan for adoption of new standards on both financial instruments and insurance contracts.
Before insurers reach any conclusions about how they apply IFRS 9, they will want to consider its interaction with the forthcoming insurance contracts standard."

Managing tax in the LNG and FLNG industry: Lessons from the front lines
","
Across the globe, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and floating LNG (FLNG) opportunities are rapidly emerging as fast, cost-effective means of unlocking new gas resources.
",Wed Jun 10 10:42:00 UTC 2015,"From a tax viewpoint, new technologies and new ways of doing business always bring new tax issues – and LNG and FLNG projects are no exception. 
Investors and operators are challenged to comply with complex income and resource tax regimes and manage indirect taxes and custom obligations across supply chains, while ensuring they don’t miss out on exemptions, incentives and recoveries. And the unprecedented features of massive, mobile FLNG projects create a raft of additional tax challenges.
What are the top tax issues being encountered by LNG and FLNG producers and investors? In this report, KPMG energy and natural resources tax professionals from member firms in South Africa, Nigeria, Japan, Canada and Australia share leading practices, lessons learned and key actions for effective tax management. 
Based on their experience advising clients on the front lines in their markets, some key actions for investors and proponents to consider include:

Confirming tax incentives and requirements related to your LNG activities in all relevant jurisdictions
Optimizing access to research and development incentives in all of your locations 
Ensuring the business reasons for your tax positions are well supported and documented 
Verifying and documenting your transfer pricing policies
Establishing a globally-integrated plan for managing indirect taxes and maximizing recoveries across your global supply chain 
Understanding the project’s local impact and meeting obligations to contribute to the local economy.

AML and the De-Risking Dilemma
","
In the global war to combat money laundering, the financial services industry appears to be nearing a dangerous tipping point. The unprecedented amount of attention being paid to AML activities in boardrooms around the globe these days is due, in large part, to the increasingly harsh penalties being doled out to institutions deemed to run afoul of AML regulations – punishments that can include billion-dollar fines, banks being stripped of their operating licenses and threats of criminal prosecution against financial institutions and the executives who are paid to lead them.
",Tue Sep 15 18:30:00 UTC 2015,"While the goal of preventing or, at the very least, minimizing money laundering and terrorist financing is critically important, regulators must be attuned to the possibility that this growing de-risking backlash could end up creating more risk within the financial system.

Green Tax Index - An exploration of green tax incentives and penalties
","
KPMG has created The Green Tax Index to increase awareness of the complex, fragmented and rapidly evolving green tax landscape worldwide. It aims to encourage companies to explore the opportunities of green tax incentives, and to reduce exposure to green tax penalties.
",Tue Mar 12 14:23:00 UTC 2013,"KPMG International has analyzed 21 countries for this report and found that all of them have green tax systems that warrant attention from corporate tax and sustainability teams. The research identified over 200 individual tax incentives and penalties of relevance to corporate sustainability. At least 30 of these have been introduced since January 2011.
There is evidence to suggest that not all corporate tax teams are fully aware of the landscape of green tax in which they operate and the incentives that may be on offer. For example, in March 2012, Bloomberg BNA surveyed tax accountants and tax lawyers in the US to gauge knowledge and awareness of tax incentives for clean energy.4 Two-thirds of those interviewed were unaware of how US clean energy tax credits work.
This is a concern. As environmental and social challenges gather pace, future business value depends on carving competitive advantage out of complex and unpredictable risks. In most sectors it requires transformational change."

The view from the top: CEOs see a powerful future for the CFO
","
CEOs are looking to their CFOs to expand their focus beyond governance and regulatory requirements, to harness technology and to enhance their role by contributing as a strategic growth partner in the C-suite. Many CEOs are not sure if their CFO is the right person to handle talent management and contribute to big-picture thinking.
",Tue Dec 09 05:00:00 UTC 2014,"The View from the Top is a new KPMG survey, conducted in collaboration with Forbes Insights, which explores the attributes of a high-performing CFO and the expectations that CEOs, business owners, chairmen of large companies, and thought leaders have of their finance function.
It reveals that there is a clear disconnect between the actual performance of the CFOs and the expectations of their bosses. For filling this gap, CFOs need to focus more on understanding their stakeholders and not remain within their finance bubble. They need to be more of a business leader and less of a finance executive.
Another important issue highlighted in the survey is that CEOs place huge value on people skills and don’t believe their CFOs are managing their finance teams well enough. Wider business partnering and leadership skills are now seen as core competencies on top of finance skills, and as a result, CFOs need to ensure they, and their teams up-skill sufficiently to meet those expectations.
The CFO must assess the ever-expanding amount of data (including non-financial information) for relevance to create insights and foresights that facilitate better and faster business decisions. A third issue concerns the higher regulatory burden. The value of the CFO decreases when they are perceived to be bogged down in compliance and risk issues."

This rise in both appetite and capacity is already being reflected in the level of transactions completed, with both completed deal volumes and deal values over the last 6 months reversing the downward trend of recent years.

Tipping point: Striking the balance between urban and rural growth
","
This article explores explore how governments can strike the right balance between rural areas and urban centers to create environments of inclusivity.
",Mon Jun 02 04:00:00 UTC 2014,"There is little doubt that urbanization is becoming the new norm in many developing countries. One need only look at what is happening in India, China and now Africa as these countries are experiencing a significant shift of their vast populations from the rural setting to the urban centers. Cities like Delhi and Mumbai are becoming so big that it is increasingly more difficult to move around the city and their population densities are one of the highest in the world.1 According to UN estimates, Lagos in Nigeria is on pace to be the third largest megacity by 2015 after Tokyo and Mumbai.2 China, on the other hand, boasts the most megacities in the world (four).3"

Communicating effectively through non-GAAP information
","
ESMA guidelines on alternative performance measures promote transparency and comparability
",Thu Jul 16 14:41:00 UTC 2015,"Guidelines on alternative performance measures issued by the European regulator, ESMA, seek to promote the presentation of transparent and comparable financial information.
GAAP rarely tells the whole story of a company’s performance. To bridge the gap, companies and investors communicate through key performance indicators (KPIs), alongside the GAAP numbers. Such KPIs are referred to, interchangeably, as ‘non-GAAP information’ and ‘alternative performance measures’ (APMs). 
This topic has prompted much debate. When do KPIs enhance GAAP by aiding communication with users, and when do they present a confusing or overly optimistic picture? To date, regulators around the world have taken different approaches to non-GAAP information. This recent development could help to drive consistency in this area.
 
“We are encouraged at the alignment between ESMA’s guidelines and those of other regulators, helping to build a globally consistent approach to the presentation of APMs.”

Improving police services by reducing demand
",Mon Mar 16 09:19:00 UTC 2015,"Today’s police forces are under incredible pressure. Many are facing the most significant budget cuts they have seen in decades and the drive for improved efficiency is stronger than ever before. At the same time, public expectations of police services have changed; shifting demographics and crime patterns, increased public participation and calls for transparency are all creating new demands on police resources.
The Changing the equation: Improving police services by reducing demand report is based on interviews of KPMG’s Justice & Security Lead Partners in the US, the UK, Canada, Netherlands, Australia and India. 
The report argues that today's police forces need to take a new approach if they hope to meet the growing pressures they now face from budgetary constraints and shifting demand. The emerging strategies, approaches and insights provided in this report reflect the experience of dozens of police forces around the world. Yet our J&S experts also recognize the unique environments that each police force operates within and so, rather than trying to provide a ‘one-size-fits-all’ blueprint for demand reduction, this paper focuses instead on identifying the enablers that are critical to successfully influence demand for police services.

Going beyond the data
","
A series of articles written by KPMG Global Indirect Tax Services professionals to help you better understand and prepare to deal with the Big Data revolution in the context of indirect taxes.
",Fri Oct 23 16:32:00 UTC 2015,"Businesses today are beginning to adapt to a world increasingly driven by data and analytics (D&A). Findings of a recent KPMG International survey indicate that all but 1 percent of organizations surveyed regard D&A as at least somewhat important to their business strategy and 56 percent said they changed their business strategy to meet the challenges of D&A, most often to increase their capacity to analyze big data. 
Are we in the midst of a Big Data revolution? Analysts believe that the quantity of data available to businesses will increase by 40 percent every year for the foreseeable future. Endeavoring to collect all this data is one thing, but businesses increasingly need to correlate it, analyze it and extract actionable value.
And what about the tax implications? Relatively little has been written about the specific application of Big Data to the world of tax, and more specifically to the area of indirect tax. By their very nature, indirect taxes contain transaction level data which, when mined and analyzed appropriately, may be transformed into knowledge and real actionable value for businesses.
Welcome to “Going beyond the data – Indirect Tax”, a series of technical articles written by KPMG Global Indirect Tax Services professionals to help you better understand and prepare to deal with the Big Data revolution in the context of indirect taxes. The article series will appear in Bloomberg BNA’s International Tax Planning: Indirect Tax publication over the coming months and added to this page.
“Going beyond the data – Indirect Tax” will explore tax policy and administration in the age of Big Data; transformation of the compliance function into competitive advantage; the use of technology tools essential for the tax function in a Big Data world; and the anticipated evolution of indirect taxation over the next decade on account of the Big Data revolution."

",Fri Oct 23 16:32:00 UTC 2015,"Businesses today are beginning to adapt to a world increasingly driven by data and analytics (D&A). Findings of a recent KPMG International survey indicate that all but 1 percent of organizations surveyed regard D&A as at least somewhat important to their business strategy and 56 percent said they changed their business strategy to meet the challenges of D&A, most often to increase their capacity to analyze big data. 
Are we in the midst of a Big Data revolution? Analysts believe that the quantity of data available to businesses will increase by 40 percent every year for the foreseeable future. Endeavoring to collect all this data is one thing, but businesses increasingly need to correlate it, analyze it and extract actionable value.
And what about the tax implications? Relatively little has been written about the specific application of Big Data to the world of tax, and more specifically to the area of indirect tax. By their very nature, indirect taxes contain transaction level data which, when mined and analyzed appropriately, may be transformed into knowledge and real actionable value for businesses.
Welcome to “Going beyond the data – Indirect Tax”, a series of technical articles written by KPMG Global Indirect Tax Services professionals to help you better understand and prepare to deal with the Big Data revolution in the context of indirect taxes. The article series will appear in Bloomberg BNA’s International Tax Planning: Indirect Tax publication over the coming months and added to this page.
“Going beyond the data – Indirect Tax” will explore tax policy and administration in the age of Big Data; transformation of the compliance function into competitive advantage; the use of technology tools essential for the tax function in a Big Data world; and the anticipated evolution of indirect taxation over the next decade on account of the Big Data revolution."

Regulation will require more disclosure of global tax data to tax authorities and in some cases publicly.

The role of business intelligence software to monitor indicators of governance, risk and compliance (GRC).
",Tue Apr 15 20:00:00 UTC 2014,"KPMG’s Global Risk Survey, Expectations of Risk Management Outpacing Capabilities – it is Time For Action found that risk management is at the top of the global executive agenda as companies face an array of threats that grow more complex by the day.
One of the leading insights to come out of the survey was that a risk program can only become fully operational when all the C-level executives are using risk management as a tool for collaborative decision-making. This can be done by embedding it into management routines (such as strategic planning, management risk committee meetings, budgeting, and corporate policy-making). The use of GRC Dashboards is an excellent way to harness technology and innovation in order to enable the embedding of risk into management routines.
In this report, we look at business intelligence software and how an organization can distill an overwhelming amount of data into a key set of governance, risk and compliance monitoring indicators. Business intelligence software is an imperative for leading companies that need to keep their finger on the pulse of performance. Risk intelligence solutions are becoming a game-changer for tracking the effectiveness of GRC activities.
Where no such applications are in place, a company has an opportunity to design executive dashboards that integrate performance data, risk indicators and information related to GRC. For companies that are already using business intelligence dashboards to track performance data; the report highlights the value of expanding these applications to create dashboards for internal GRC stakeholders."

These tariff reduction rates exceeded other free trade agreement tariff reduction rates (generally, approximately 90%).
Based on preliminary calculation, the customs duty of export merchandise from China to Australia will be reduced, with Chinese goods having a comparatively high reduction of customs duty to include clothes, leather, electronics and machines, other manufactures, steel and metal products, and chemicals. Australian goods that can have a comparatively high reduction of customs duty include energy, steel and metal products, and beef, wool, dairy, and other farm products.

Uncharted waters: LNG demand in a transforming industry
","
A transforming LNG market is marked by globalization, changing pricing models, and major demand uncertainties. Prices have fallen sharply and the market appears likely to be over-supplied for some years.
",Mon Nov 16 12:11:00 UTC 2015,"Traditional Japan-South Korea-Taiwan LNG buyers appear mature, while European demand depends heavily on Russian strategies, as well as environmental policy. Chinese LNG requirements are key, but influenced strongly by pipeline gas competition, economic growth and coal use. Emerging LNG markets in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and in transport (shipping and road) present a major growth opportunity, but have to be developed actively.
Such an LNG market presents all participants with challenges. Uncertainty over demand from traditionally dominant buyers requires eyes for new markets from LNG producers and traders. They have to understand buyers' strategies and maintain optionality and competitiveness in their portfolio of supply – and be ready to launch new projects quickly -- when market conditions permit.
Buyers, conversely, should make the most of their current strong position, while deploying new strategies. They need to understand their bargaining position as well as that of sellers; engaging on regulation and government policy; and creating buyer alliances such as Japan's JERA.
The winners along the value chain will be those who can act counter cyclically, who can create and maximize markets, instead of reacting passively to them, who can identify the major long-term trends driving LNG demand, while also staying flexible to seize emerging opportunities."

Taxation of international executives
",Fri Jan 02 00:00:00 UTC 2015,"Individuals are classified either as resident or non-resident taxpayers. Resident taxpayers are taxed on their worldwide income. However, tax residents in Korea of foreign nationality who have had a domicile or place of residence in Korea for five years or less in aggregate in the previous ten years ending on the last date of the tax year concerned, will not be subject to Korean income tax in relation to their foreign-source income attributable to that tax year unless the income is paid in or remitted to Korea. Non-resident taxpayers are taxed only on Korean sources of income.
Income tax is calculated by applying a progressive tax rate schedule from 6 percent to 38 percent (exclusive of the resident tax that is a surtax of 10 percent of the income tax amount) to taxable income.1
As a result of the international environment and the large expatriate community in Korea, the income tax law incorporates a number of special features, including a distinction between employment income borne by a Korean entity and employment income borne by a non-Korean entity.
A separate tax calculation must be made for each of the three major income categories: composite income, retirement income, and capital gains income. Each category has a unique tax base and/or rate structure.

Bosnia and Herzegovina - Overview and introduction
","
Taxation of international executives
",Thu Jul 02 17:35:22 UTC 2015,"In order to understand the origin/basis of the tax systems in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), reference must be made to the Dayton Agreement (Dayton) of 1995.
Dayton established a Constitution for BiH, a Constitution for the Entities – the Federation of BiH (FBiH) and the Republic of Srpska (RS); subsequently the Brcko District was created as a third Entity (as this Entity is quite small it is not further discussed). Consequently, taxation systems, rates, and so on, vary between the three entities in BiH and BiH itself.
The capital of BiH is Sarajevo, which is in the FBiH.
The FBiH itself consists ten cantons: of Unsko-sanski Canton, Posavski Canton, Tuzlanski Canton, Zenicko-dobojski Canton, Bosansko-podrinjski Canton, Srednjobosanski Canton, Hercegovacko-neretvanski Canton, Zapadnohercegovacki Canton, Canton 10, and Sarajevo Canton (SC).
Personal income tax (PIT) is regulated at the entities' level.
Generally, both entities (the FBiH and the RS) exercise the source rule to their residents and non-residents (each entity exercises the right to tax all individuals, whether resident in that entity or not, on income arising in that entity), while residents are also taxed under the residence rule (residents are taxed on income that arises outside that specific entity). 
In order to work in BiH, a foreign citizen must have a work permit. Work permits are based on employment in BiH and therefore upon issuance of a work permit a foreign citizen must enter into a labor agreement with a local (that is BiH) company. This applies to both entities.
Issuance of work permits in both entities is subject to quotas (i.e. Governments of respective entities prescribe on annual level a specific number of available new work permits that may be issued per specific sector of industry). Please note that there are some exemptions from the quota system: most importantly, the issuance of work permits for directors and key personnel of companies in BiH does not fall under the quota system. However, directors and key personnel still need to enter into a labour agreement with a local (BiH) company.
The official currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the Convertible Mark (BAM).

CBP regulations require carriers to submit a paper manifest for export air shipments generally within four days after departure.
The CBP general notice [PDF 202 KB] provides a description of the test, sets forth eligibility requirements for participation, and invites public comment on any aspect of the test.
The test will begin no earlier than 30 days after 10 July 2015 (the date when the general notice will be published in the Federal Register) and will run for approximately two years. CBP is accepting applications for participation in this planned test until CBP has received applications from nine parties that meet all test participant requirements.

Currently, it is not clear whether (and when) the TTIP negotiations would come to an end. If a TTIP is concluded between the EU and the United States, it would likely take two to three years before the TTIP will actually take effect.

G20-OECD BEPS Action Plan - Taking the pulse in the Americas region
","
For tax executives of international companies headquartered in the Americas, the future of international taxation has never been more uncertain. The global project to address tax base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is in full swing, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Action Plan on BEPS is progressing quickly. The OECD’s recommendations are starting to take shape, but what it will ultimately recommend and how individual countries will translate these recommendations into law are still unknown. While countries in Europe and North America may appear to have the strongest voices in the debate, many countries in Latin America are influencing – and being influenced by – the profound international taxation changes that are under review.
",Fri Jan 02 00:00:00 UTC 2015,"At the mid- point in the OECD Action Plan's two year mandate, KPMG International (""KPMG"") polled senior tax policy specialists in KPMG member firms across the Americas to take stock of trends and developments in these countries. In particular, we asked:

How are Americas' governments responding to the OECD BEPS Action Plan currently in progress?
Which governments may adopt the new international tax guidelines that will result?
What unilateral actions to combat BEPS and other perceived tax avoidance are governments in the Americas taking and / or considering outside of the OECD BEPS process?
What are the potential implications for international companies doing business in the region?

Our findings are set out in this publication, starting with an overview of BEPS-related trends in the region as a whole, followed by an in-depth look at how events are unfolding in selected Americas countries. We conclude with guidance that tax directors of international companies should consider now to address these changes and help them continue to thrive in the Americas' new tax reality. "

",Thu Jun 18 19:14:00 UTC 2015,"Today’s business is no longer just regional – it is international or even global. New fast growing markets, free trade agreements and cross-border business opportunities make traditional borders less visible. Mergers, acquisitions and intercompany structuring have highly increased and become significantly more complex.
Buying a new business abroad is not as manageable as it is in a national home market. Before a closing of a cross-border merger – as often heard on the business news – a structured process needs to be followed. And, with a global workforce and attractive business locations, the relocation of companies often is considered a possible future strategy.

Information on account balances, sale proceeds from financial assets, and income from certain insurance products

The EC stated that these rules are consistent with the OECD global standard of exchange, meaning that EU tax authorities will be able to use one single format for exchanging information both within and outside the EU. 
EU Member States have also committed to a proposal by the EC to further improve the rules in 2019 by adding more information fields and to consider any other necessary adjustments.

Expect the Unexpected: Building business value in a changing world
","
KPMG analyzes megaforces that will impact each and every business over the next 20 years.
",Fri Feb 10 05:00:00 UTC 2012,"The resources on which business relies are becoming more difficult to access and more costly. Changing patterns of economic growth and wealth are likely to strain infrastructure and natural systems. The unpredictable results of a changing climate will affect physical assets and supply chains. And businesses can expect an ever more complex web of sustainability legislation and fiscal instruments.
In this report, KPMG's network of firms analyzes a system of ten sustainability megaforces that will impact each and every business over the next 20 years.
It is important for business leaders to understand this system of forces; assess the implications for their own organizations; and devise strategies for managing the risks and harnessing the opportunities.
We can never know the future. But it is good business sense to be prepared for the possibilities: to expect the unexpected. In this report KPMG suggests approaches to help build business value in a changing world.
The executive summary (PDF 585 KB) of the Expect the Unexpected: Building Business Value in a Changing World report shows that population growth, exploitation of natural resources, climate change and other factors are putting the world on a development trajectory that is not sustainable. In other words, if we fail to alter our patterns of production and consumption, things will begin to go badly wrong. How wrong and for whom, is also explored in the report.

Designing a Better Report
","
Narrative reporting content in Annual Reports / 10Ks – the ‘MD&A’ - is receiving growing focus from investors and regulators alike. Preparers are increasingly being asked to focus on the matters most relevant to the future of their business, rather than following a list of prescribed disclosures. The result is much greater emphasis on the business model and strategy as a basis for reporting. But building a report around your business strategy can be daunting without the comfort-blanket of a disclosure checklist. For those that succeed, the potential reward is a more concise report that is focused on the key drivers of business value – one that is better equipped to support an effective investor dialogue.

EU: Savings tax directive is repealed, replaced by new standard
","
The EU savings taxation directive (Directive 2003/48/EC), that allowed tax administrations to have access to information about “private savers,” was repealed on 10 November 2015 by the European Council. The repeal of the savings taxation directive follows a strengthening of global measures to prevent tax evasion—e.g., the OECD’s common reporting standard (CRS)—and is intended to eliminate overlap with other information reporting regimes.
",Wed Nov 11 15:59:00 UTC 2015,"An EC release (11 November 2015) explains that the savings taxation directive (which had been effective since 2005) required the automatic exchange of information between EU Member States on private savings income. This treatment enabled interest payments made in one EU Member State to residents of other EU Member States to be taxed according to the laws of the state of the taxpayer’s residence. 
In December 2014, the European Council adopted Directive 2014/107/EU, amending provisions concerning the mandatory automatic exchange of information between tax administrations. The new directive extends the scope of information exchange to include interest, dividends, and other types of income and: 

Is effective 1 January 2016
Is generally broader in scope than directive 2003/48/EC

The governor of California has signed into law, legislation (S.B. 633) that provides an exemption for certain merchandise from the California “Made in U.S.A.” rules if it includes a small amount of articles, units, or parts that originate from outside the United States.
",Thu Sep 03 19:26:00 UTC 2015,"Before this change, California law prohibited the sale of merchandise that showed the words ""Made in U.S.A.,"" ""Made in America,"" ""U.S.A."" when the merchandise (or any article, unit, or part of it) was entirely or substantially made, manufactured, or produced outside of the United States.
S.B. 633 exempts from the “Made in U.S.A.” label prohibition any merchandise that was made, manufactured, or produced in the United States if either:

The merchandise has one or more articles, units, or parts from outside the United States that do not constitute more than 5% of the final wholesale value of the product; or
The manufacturer makes a specified showing regarding the articles, units, or parts from outside the United States and they do not constitute more than 10% of the final wholesale value of the product.

The provisions under the new law also do not apply to merchandise sold for resale to consumers outside of the state. Merchandise offered or sold outside the state would not be deemed mislabeled if the label conforms to the law of that state or country.

gaining interest and guidance from boards and corporate leadership in the development of tax department strategies that align with the company’s overall business strategy, in part due to rising regulation of the sector globally
centralizing the management and structure of resources in global or business-wide headquarters tax departments to improve accountability, control and standardize approaches
well advanced in their efforts to standardize tax department roles and processes and putting priority on investments in improving their tax and finance function processes and controls in order to meet more extensive tax, financial and non-financial reporting demands
less likely than their peers in other industries to use outsourcing, co-sourcing and shared service centers to carry out or support tax department activities, partly due to highly specific and complex ENR tax regimes
putting more emphasis on compliance-related activities than on improving connectivity with other parts of the business and other, more strategic pursuits
in need of further investments in improving processes and technology to keep pace with rising tax compliance audit demands while freeing tax department time to engage in more strategic pursuits that influence the bottom line.

Global Compliance Management Services

Today's unprecedented economic challenges are forcing companies to rethink the way they do business. For many, this includes taking a closer look at how they manage their compliance obligations on a world-wide basis. By outsourcing an organization can, at a minimum, capitalize on the economies of scale, specialized labor and the application of industry best practices (assuring processes are aligned with current regulatory demands) available through an external service provider.
",Thu May 09 04:00:00 UTC 2013,"Managing tax and statutory compliance in today’s highly complex economic and regulatory environment is no easy task. Rapid globalization, new developments in tax laws, changes in accounting standards and increased demands from revenue authorities for greater transparency and cooperation are all increasing the burden on tax and finance departments. At the same time, they are expected to provide more and better reporting and compliance in an ever shorter time frame. Complicating matters are a dearth of qualified, experienced compliance professionals and the challenge of obtaining timely and accurate data from accounting and ERP systems and shared service centers not often set up for in-country compliance.
Given these challenges, it’s not surprising that tax and finance departments often spend a disproportionate amount of time on compliance activities, rather than focusing on higher value activities such as strategic tax planning, risk management and closer integration with the rest of the business.
As a result, many companies are looking for more consistent, more efficient and more cost effective ways to meet their compliance obligations."

China: Customs guidance, imports of aviation supplies, aircraft operating leases

China’s General Administration of Customs issued guidance concerning the collection of tax (customs duty) and price verification with
respect to imported aviation supplies and aircraft operating leases.
",Fri Feb 19 20:50:00 UTC 2016,"Before this new guidance, the methods used for classifying and administering the tax (duty) collection with respect to imported aviation supplies were not unified among local customs offices. Also the price verification of maintenance and overhaul fees at the end of an aircraft lease differed among the customs authorities. These differences increased customs clearance costs and reduced customs clearance efficiency. The guidance, therefore, was issued to standardize enforcement and to regulation the management of imports of aviation supplies. 
The guidance was issued in two parts, known in English as: 

“Announcement of the General Administration of Customs on issues concerning collection of taxes on maintenance guarantee for aviation supplies” or Announcement of the General Administration of Customs [2016] No. 6—in general this guidance addresses the protection system of reliance interest of airlines; facilitates customs clearance and tax payment of aviation supplies with maintenance guarantee; and increases the responsibility of airlines, requiring them to keep and manage the related documents necessary for tax payment
“Announcement on revising the relevant provisions on the assessment and determination of the duty-paid value of aircraft under operating leases” or Announcement of the General Administration of Customs [2016] No. 8—in general, this guidance enhances and strengthens provisions of previous announcements
